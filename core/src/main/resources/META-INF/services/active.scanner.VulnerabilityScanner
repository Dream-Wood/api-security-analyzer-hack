# Vulnerability Scanner Service Providers
# Auto-discovered by ServiceLoader
#
# Add your scanner implementation here:
# Format: fully.qualified.ClassName
#
# NOTE: All built-in scanners have been moved to the plugins/ module.
# They are now loaded dynamically as hot-swappable plugins.
#
# To add a new scanner:
# 1. Create a new plugin module in plugins/
# 2. Build it: mvn clean package
# 3. The JAR will be automatically placed in the plugins/ directory
# 4. Restart the application - the scanner will be auto-loaded!
#
# No built-in scanners configured - all scanners are loaded as plugins
