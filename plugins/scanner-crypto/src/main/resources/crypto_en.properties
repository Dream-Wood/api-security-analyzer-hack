# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.http_usage.description=The API is accessible over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This means all data transmitted between client and server is sent in plaintext, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data tampering. HTTPS with TLS encryption is essential for protecting sensitive data in transit.

vuln.weak_algorithms.description=The API response indicates use of weak or deprecated cryptographic algorithms. Detected: {0}. Weak algorithms like MD5, SHA1, DES, and RC4 are vulnerable to collision attacks, brute force, and other cryptanalytic techniques. They should not be used for security purposes.

vuln.weak_tls.description=The API appears to support weak TLS/SSL versions: {0}. Protocols like SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1 have known vulnerabilities (POODLE, BEAST, etc.) and should be disabled. Only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 should be enabled.

vuln.weak_ciphers.description=The API response contains references to weak cipher suites: {0}. Weak ciphers can be vulnerable to various attacks including brute force and cryptanalysis. Only strong, modern cipher suites should be used.

vuln.hardcoded_keys.description=The API response contains hardcoded cryptographic keys or private keys. This is a critical security vulnerability as it exposes the keys that should remain secret. Attackers can use these keys to decrypt sensitive data, forge signatures, or bypass encryption entirely.
