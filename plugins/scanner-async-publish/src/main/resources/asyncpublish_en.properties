# Vulnerability Titles
vuln.unauthorized_publish.title=Unauthorized Publishing to Channel ''{0}''

# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.unauthorized_publish.description=The channel ''{0}'' allows publishing messages without authentication. {1}Unauthorized actors could publish malicious messages, inject false data, or overwhelm the system with unwanted events.
vuln.unauthorized_publish.description.critical=This channel appears to be critical for system operation based on its name, which significantly increases the risk and potential impact.

# Recommendations
vuln.recommendation1=Implement authentication for all PUBLISH operations
vuln.recommendation2=Use protocol-specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., SASL for Kafka, ACLs for MQTT)
vuln.recommendation3=Implement authorization checks to verify publisher identity and permissions
vuln.recommendation4=Add message validation and rate limiting to prevent abuse
vuln.recommendation5=Use secure protocols (wss, mqtts, kafka-secure) with TLS/SSL encryption

# Reproduction Steps
vuln.unauthorized_publish.repro.step1=Connect to the {0} server without providing authentication credentials
vuln.unauthorized_publish.repro.step2=Attempt to publish a test message to channel ''{0}''
vuln.unauthorized_publish.repro.step3=Observe that the publish operation succeeds without authentication
vuln.unauthorized_publish.repro.step4=Verify that no authentication challenge was presented
