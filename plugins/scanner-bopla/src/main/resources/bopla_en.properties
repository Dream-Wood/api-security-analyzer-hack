# Vulnerability Titles

vuln.role_based.title=Potential Role-Based Property Access Issue

# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.sensitive_exposure.description=The endpoint exposes sensitive properties in the response. Found sensitive property names: {0}. Detected sensitive data patterns: {1}. Sensitive properties should be filtered based on user roles and access levels.

vuln.excessive_data.description=The endpoint exposes excessive or internal data. Found internal properties: {0}. Response contains {1} properties, which may indicate over-exposure. APIs should only return data necessary for the client''s use case.

vuln.mass_assignment.description=The endpoint accepts a request with protected field assignments without proper validation. Attempted to set protected fields (is_admin, role, balance, verified) and received {0} status. This could allow attackers to modify properties they shouldn''t have access to.

vuln.role_based.description=The endpoint returns properties that appear to be role-specific: {0}. Verify that these properties are only accessible to authorized roles.

# Recommendations
vuln.recommendation1=Implement property-level access control based on user roles
vuln.recommendation2=Use DTOs/serialization groups to control exposed fields
vuln.recommendation3=Never expose sensitive fields like passwords, tokens, or PII
vuln.recommendation4=Apply the principle of least privilege for data access
vuln.recommendation5=Return only the fields needed for the specific use case
vuln.recommendation6=Use DTOs to define explicit API contracts
vuln.recommendation7=Remove internal/debug fields from production responses
vuln.recommendation8=Implement field filtering (e.g., sparse fieldsets, GraphQL)
vuln.recommendation9=Use allowlists (not blocklists) for accepting user input properties
vuln.recommendation10=Define explicit DTOs with only modifiable fields
vuln.recommendation11=Validate that sensitive fields cannot be modified by users
vuln.recommendation12=Implement proper authorization checks for property updates
vuln.recommendation13=Implement property-level authorization based on user roles
vuln.recommendation14=Use different serialization views for different user roles
vuln.recommendation15=Verify authorization for each sensitive property access

# Reproduction Steps - Sensitive Property Exposure
vuln.sensitive_exposure.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.sensitive_exposure.repro.step2=Examine response body for sensitive properties
vuln.sensitive_exposure.repro.step3=Observe exposure of: {0}

# Reproduction Steps - Excessive Data Exposure
vuln.excessive_data.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.excessive_data.repro.step2=Examine response body for excessive fields
vuln.excessive_data.repro.step3=Count exposed properties: {0}

# Reproduction Steps - Mass Assignment
vuln.mass_assignment.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.mass_assignment.repro.step2=Include protected fields in request body: {0}

# Reproduction Steps - Role-Based Property Access
vuln.role_based.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.role_based.repro.step2=Authenticate with different user roles
