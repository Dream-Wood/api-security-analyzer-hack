scanner.description=Detects Broken Function Level Authorization (BFLA) vulnerabilities

# Vulnerability Titles
vuln.admin_path.title=Unauthorized Access to Administrative Function
vuln.method_tampering.title=HTTP Method Tampering Allows Privileged Operations
vuln.delete_operation.title=Unauthorized DELETE Operation Allowed
vuln.admin_function.title=Predictable Administrative Function Accessible

# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.admin_path.description=Successfully accessed administrative endpoint variant ''{0}'' which should be restricted to administrative users only. The application does not properly enforce function-level authorization, allowing regular users to access privileged administrative functions.

vuln.method_tampering.description=The endpoint accepts privileged HTTP method ''{0}'' when the documented/expected method is ''{1}''. This allows users to perform privileged operations (modification/deletion) without proper authorization checks.

vuln.delete_operation.description=The endpoint allows DELETE operations without proper authorization checks. DELETE is a privileged operation that should typically require administrative permissions, but it was executed successfully with regular user credentials.

vuln.admin_function.description=Discovered accessible administrative function ''{0}'' through predictable naming patterns. This function should be restricted to administrators but is accessible with regular user credentials.

# Recommendations
vuln.recommendation1=Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for all administrative functions
vuln.recommendation2=Verify user roles/permissions before executing privileged operations
vuln.recommendation3=Return 403 Forbidden for unauthorized function access attempts
vuln.recommendation4=Use a centralized authorization framework
vuln.recommendation5=Follow principle of least privilege
vuln.recommendation6=Implement method-level authorization checks
vuln.recommendation7=Explicitly whitelist allowed HTTP methods per endpoint
vuln.recommendation8=Return 405 Method Not Allowed for unsupported methods
vuln.recommendation9=Verify permissions match the operation being performed
vuln.recommendation10=Implement strict authorization for DELETE operations
vuln.recommendation11=Require admin role verification for destructive operations
vuln.recommendation12=Log and audit all DELETE operations
vuln.recommendation13=Consider implementing soft deletes instead of hard deletes
vuln.recommendation14=Implement authorization checks on all administrative functions
vuln.recommendation15=Avoid predictable naming patterns for sensitive functions
vuln.recommendation16=Use security through proper design, not obscurity
vuln.recommendation17=Implement deny-by-default access control

# Reproduction Steps
vuln.admin_path.repro.step1=Authenticate with regular user credentials
vuln.admin_path.repro.step2=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.admin_path.repro.step3=Observe {0} response (expected 403 Forbidden for non-admin users)

vuln.method_tampering.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.method_tampering.repro.step2=Observe {0} response
vuln.method_tampering.repro.step3=Operation succeeds despite lack of authorization for privileged method

vuln.delete_operation.repro.step1=Send DELETE request to {0} with regular user credentials
vuln.delete_operation.repro.step2=Observe {0} response
vuln.delete_operation.repro.step3=DELETE operation succeeds without admin authorization

vuln.admin_function.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.admin_function.repro.step2=Observe {0} response
vuln.admin_function.repro.step3=Administrative function is accessible without admin privileges
