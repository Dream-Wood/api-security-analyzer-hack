scanner.name=Unrestricted Business Flow Scanner
scanner.description=Detects unrestricted access to sensitive business flows including missing rate limits and automation protection

# Vulnerability Titles
vuln.rate_limiting.title=Missing Rate Limiting on Sensitive Business Flow
vuln.automation.title=Missing Automation Protection on Sensitive Business Flow

# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.rate_limiting.description=The endpoint allows unlimited rapid requests without any rate limiting. This can be exploited to automate sensitive business operations, leading to business logic abuse, inventory depletion, financial fraud, or resource exhaustion. Sent {0} rapid requests and all {1} succeeded without throttling.

vuln.automation.description=The endpoint accepts automated/scripted requests without any bot detection or CAPTCHA challenges. Requests with clear automation indicators (bot user-agent, automation headers) are processed successfully. This allows attackers to automate abuse of sensitive business operations at scale.

# Recommendations - Rate Limiting
vuln.recommendation1=Implement rate limiting on all sensitive business operations
vuln.recommendation2=Use sliding window or token bucket algorithms for rate limiting
vuln.recommendation3=Return 429 Too Many Requests when rate limit is exceeded
vuln.recommendation4=Add Retry-After header to indicate when to retry
vuln.recommendation5=Implement per-user and per-IP rate limiting
vuln.recommendation6=Monitor and alert on unusual request patterns

# Recommendations - Automation Protection
vuln.recommendation7=Implement CAPTCHA challenges for sensitive operations
vuln.recommendation8=Add bot detection mechanisms (behavioral analysis, fingerprinting)
vuln.recommendation9=Monitor for automation patterns (timing, user-agent, request patterns)
vuln.recommendation10=Require additional verification for suspicious activity
vuln.recommendation11=Implement device fingerprinting and trust scoring
vuln.recommendation12=Add progressive delays for repeated operations

# Reproduction Steps - Rate Limiting
vuln.rate_limiting.repro.step1=Send {0} rapid {1} requests to {2}
vuln.rate_limiting.repro.step2=Observe that all requests succeed without rate limiting
vuln.rate_limiting.repro.step3=Status codes received: {0}
vuln.rate_limiting.repro.step4=Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after a threshold

# Reproduction Steps - Automation
vuln.automation.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.automation.repro.step2=Use bot-like User-Agent: ''Python/3.9 requests/2.28.0''
vuln.automation.repro.step3=Add X-Automation header
vuln.automation.repro.step4=Observe {0} success response
vuln.automation.repro.step5=Repeat multiple times - all requests succeed without challenge

# Logging Messages
log.testing_rate_limiting=Testing rate limiting for: {0}
log.testing_automation=Testing automation detection for: {0}
