# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.error_based.description=The endpoint is vulnerable to OS Command Injection. Shell error messages were detected in the response when injecting command syntax into the ''{0}'' parameter. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

vuln.output_based.description=The endpoint is vulnerable to OS Command Injection. Command output (''{0}'') was detected in the response when injecting command syntax into the ''{1}'' parameter.

vuln.time_blind.description=The endpoint is vulnerable to Time-based Blind Command Injection. The application''s response was delayed by approximately {0} seconds when a time-delay command was injected into the ''{1}'' parameter.

vuln.body.description=The endpoint is vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the request body field ''{0}''. Shell error messages were detected when injecting command syntax into the JSON body.

vuln.header.description=The endpoint is vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the HTTP header ''{0}''. Shell error messages were detected when injecting command syntax into the header. This is particularly dangerous as headers are often passed to backend commands, logging systems, or external processes.

# Recommendations
vuln.recommendation1=Never pass user input directly to system commands
vuln.recommendation2=Use parameterized APIs that don't invoke a shell
vuln.recommendation3=Implement strict input validation with whitelists
vuln.recommendation4=Apply the principle of least privilege for application processes
vuln.recommendation5=Use sandboxing or containerization to limit damage
vuln.recommendation6=Monitor and log all command executions
vuln.recommendation7=Disable dangerous functions in production environments

# Reproduction Steps
vuln.error_based.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.error_based.repro.step2=Set parameter ''{0}'' to: {1}
vuln.error_based.repro.step3=Observe shell error or command output in response

vuln.output_based.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.output_based.repro.step2=Observe command output in response

vuln.time_blind.repro.step1=Measure baseline response time (~{0}ms)
vuln.time_blind.repro.step2=Send request with time-delay payload
vuln.time_blind.repro.step3=Observe delayed response (~{0}ms)

vuln.body.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.body.repro.step2=Include JSON body with field ''{0}'' set to: {1}
vuln.body.repro.step3=Observe shell error in response

vuln.header.repro.step1=Send {0} request to {1}
vuln.header.repro.step2=Include header ''{0}: {1}''
vuln.header.repro.step3=Observe shell error in response
