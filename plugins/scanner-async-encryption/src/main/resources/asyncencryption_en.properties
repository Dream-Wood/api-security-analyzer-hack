# Async Missing Encryption Scanner English Localization
# Encoding: UTF-8

scanner.name=Missing Encryption Scanner
scanner.description=Detects use of unencrypted protocols (ws, mqtt, kafka, amqp, http) that expose message content to eavesdropping and MITM attacks.

# Vulnerability Titles
vuln.missing_encryption.title=Missing Encryption: {0} Protocol Used for Channel ''{1}''

# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.missing_encryption.description=The channel ''{0}'' uses the unencrypted {1} protocol. All message content is transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and message tampering. Use {2} instead to ensure confidentiality and integrity of message data.

# Recommendations
vuln.recommendation1=Migrate to {0} protocol with TLS/SSL encryption
vuln.recommendation2=Configure proper certificate validation (avoid self-signed certificates in production)
vuln.recommendation3=Use strong cipher suites and disable weak/deprecated protocols (SSLv3, TLS 1.0)
vuln.recommendation4=Implement certificate pinning for additional security in sensitive environments
vuln.recommendation5=Ensure all clients and brokers are configured to use encrypted connections only

# Reproduction Steps
vuln.missing_encryption.repro.step1=Analyze server configuration and observe {0} protocol is used
vuln.missing_encryption.repro.step2=Connect to channel ''{0}'' using the unencrypted protocol
vuln.missing_encryption.repro.step3=Use network sniffing tools (e.g., Wireshark) to capture traffic
vuln.missing_encryption.repro.step4=Observe message content in plaintext; recommend migrating to {0}

# Logging Messages
log.scanning_operation=Checking protocol security for channel: {0}
log.found_vulnerability=Found unencrypted protocol {0} in channel ''{1}''
log.secure_protocol=Channel ''{1}'' uses secure protocol: {0}

status.scanning=Scanning for missing encryption...
status.completed=Encryption scan completed
