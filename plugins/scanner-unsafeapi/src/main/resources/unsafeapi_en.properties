# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.timeout.description=The endpoint appears to integrate with external APIs but does not expose timeout configuration indicators. Without proper timeouts, the application may hang indefinitely waiting for slow or unresponsive third-party services, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service. External API calls should have strict timeout limits to prevent cascading failures.

vuln.integration.description=The endpoint integrates with external APIs but shows no evidence of data validation or integrity checks. Blindly trusting external data can lead to injection attacks, data corruption, and business logic bypasses. All data from external sources must be validated, sanitized, and verified before use. Integration headers found: {0}

vuln.ssrf.description=The endpoint accepts URL parameters and may not properly validate them, potentially allowing Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks. When consuming external APIs through user-controlled URLs, applications must validate against allowlists and block access to internal resources. SSRF can lead to internal network scanning, cloud metadata exposure, and unauthorized access to internal services.

vuln.redirect.description=The endpoint issues redirects but shows no evidence of redirect validation. When consuming external APIs that may redirect, applications must validate redirect targets to prevent attacks through malicious redirects to internal resources or unexpected domains. Unvalidated redirects in API consumption can lead to SSRF and data leakage.

vuln.validation.description=The endpoint may consume data from external APIs without proper validation. All data from external sources must be validated against expected schemas, sanitized to prevent injection attacks, and verified for integrity. Unsafe consumption of external data can lead to injection vulnerabilities, business logic bypasses, and data corruption.

# Recommendations
