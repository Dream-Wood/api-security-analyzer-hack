scanner.name=Unauthorized Subscription Scanner
scanner.description=Detects SUBSCRIBE operations that can be performed without authentication, potentially exposing sensitive message streams to unauthorized consumers.

# Vulnerability Titles
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.title=Unauthorized Subscription to Channel ''{0}''

# Vulnerability Descriptions
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.description=The channel ''{0}'' allows subscription without authentication. {1}Unauthorized consumers could subscribe to this channel and receive all messages, potentially accessing sensitive information.
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.description.sensitive=This channel appears to contain sensitive data based on its name, which significantly increases the risk of data exposure.

# Recommendations
vuln.recommendation1=Implement authentication for all SUBSCRIBE operations
vuln.recommendation2=Use protocol-specific authentication mechanisms (e.g., SASL for Kafka, username/password for MQTT)
vuln.recommendation3=Consider implementing authorization checks based on user identity and channel permissions
vuln.recommendation4=Audit all channels to ensure sensitive data is properly protected
vuln.recommendation5=Use secure protocols (wss, mqtts, kafka-secure) with TLS/SSL encryption

# Reproduction Steps
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.repro.step1=Connect to the {0} server without providing authentication credentials
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.repro.step2=Subscribe to the channel ''{0}''
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.repro.step3=Observe that subscription succeeds and messages can be received
vuln.unauthorized_subscription.repro.step4=Verify that no authentication challenge was presented
